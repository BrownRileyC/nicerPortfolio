                        <h4>About Me</h4>
                        <p>My name is Riley Brown. I was born and raised in the suburbs of Philadelphia. I attended
                            William Penn Charter school and then studied psychology at the University of Vermont with a
                            focus on
                            developmental psychology. It's a fascinating field, in my opinion, and something very
                            deserving of more study.</p>
                        <p>After graduating I decided to pursue a career working with young children, but not as a
                            counselor and instead an educator. I was lucky to find a position working as a preschool and
                            kindergarten prepratory teacher.</p>
                        <p>After my two years working with these children I realized that while I love working with kids
                            that young, it wasn't what I wanted to do the rest of my life. That's what led me here.</p>

                            <p>Over the course of my studies I have created a variety of different applications.</p>
                            <p>Several of these applications were quite simple and truly just an exercise in showing an
                                understanding of the subject.</p>
                            <p>Some projects were more substantial and were intended as a chance to build something
                                useful.</p>
                            <p>These are those projects and where you can observe them.</p>
