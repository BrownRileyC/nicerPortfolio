                                <h4>About Me</h4>
                                <p>I was born and raised in the suburbs of Philadelphia. I
                                    attended
                                    William Penn Charter school and then studied psychology at the University of Vermont
                                    with a
                                    focus on
                                    developmental psychology. It's a fascinating field, in my opinion, and something
                                    very
                                    deserving of more study.</p>
                                <p>After graduating I decided to pursue a career working with young children, but not as
                                    a
                                    counselor and instead an educator. I was lucky to find a position working as a
                                    preschool
                                    and
                                    kindergarten prepratory teacher.</p>
                                <p>I loved working as a teacher and it was a privilege to see the children growing older
                                    and learning over the two years I spent at the Bright Horizons Child Development
                                    Center. While working there I discovered my interest in programming and development.
                                    I began to search for a way to enter the field, and I was fortunate enough to
                                    discover an intensive course of study that would help me to begin my career in web
                                    development.
                                </p>
                                <p>While studying, I had many oportunities to learn valuable skills. One of the most
                                    important, I think, is to check the little
                                    things when I run into problems. Another vital skill is the ability both to work
                                    with others and to discuss my issues with others. I had many excellent classmates
                                    who helped me understand difficult concepts and who I helped in turn. Communication
                                    is a vital skill to have, and my interactions with my classmates showed me the power
                                    it can have to solve problems.</p>
